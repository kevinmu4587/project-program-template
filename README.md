## About the Project
Maze Maker is an online game about designing and playing your own mazes! You can save and load previously designed mazes at any time. Our game also has a built-in algorithm to solve any maze in case you are ever stuck.

Maze Maker was built using HTML, JavaScript, PixiJS and ExpressJS.
